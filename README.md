Understanding Interactions Effects, Fixed Effects in Linear and Logistic Regression
- Trained a Linear Regression model to see interaction between sales in multiple areas and how they affect total_sales
- In this model, it can be concluded that the sales in area 1 interacts with the sales in area 2 to give combined effect on target variable i.e. total sales hence the interaction term needs to be included in the model to make it more accurate
- Trained and Compared multiple Logistic Regression Model to predict whether the customer will purchase the product or not and selected the best model based on i. Accuracy (78.5%) ii. Out of Sample R^2 and iii. Prediction Error
- In Logistic Regression, interaction effects don't seem to make any difference
